# Horiseon-FrontEnd
Refactored FrontEnd code for Horiseon landing page

## Project Description

This project centralises around web accessibility. An important focus for businesses with an online presence, ensuring that users who require additional forms accessibility and help are assisted with the aid of built in web features for use within video captions, screen readers and braille keyboards. This improves the websites visibility on search engines such as Google or Bing. Helping to improve exposure of the site and brand, helping the business as a whole.

The project also effectively demonstrates a common FrontEnd developer task of refactoring. This involves changing the source code of an existing product or service, to include new standards, technologies or coding practices, without changing what the product or service does.

### Completed Task:

* Refactored HTML to follow a sematic structure.
* Reorganised and refactored CSS, removing dupe code.
* Addition of alt attributes.
* Heading attributes added in sequential order.
* Inclusion of a concise title.


## Installation

This single static website can be deployed either locally or to a webserver. With the included "index.html" file containing the main code for the website, and the accompanying "style.css" stylesheet. Alternatively, the website can be found on the GitHub Pages link below.

Designed primarily for a desktop experience, the site can be accessed on small screen sizes, however elements are expected to overlap or spill beyond their original containers.
